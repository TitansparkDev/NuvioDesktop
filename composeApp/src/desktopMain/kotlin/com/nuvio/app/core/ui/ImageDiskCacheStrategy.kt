/**
 * What Nuvio's image disk cache is allowed to keep, and for how long.
 *
 * Coil's `CacheStrategy.DEFAULT` does two things that are wrong for artwork:
 *
 * 1. Its `write` caches any response whose code is 2xx **or in `{300, 301, 404, 405, 410, 414,
 *    501}`** — a 404 is stored exactly like a hit.
 * 2. Its `read` returns the cached response unconditionally. No expiry, no `Cache-Control`, no
 *    revalidation. Coil's own comment in `NetworkFetcher.doFetch` says as much: only a
 *    "cache-aware" strategy can "issue a fresh request when a cached failure (e.g. 404) has
 *    expired".
 *
 * Together those make one unlucky miss permanent. Metadata providers publish artwork *late* and
 * synthesize URLs for images that do not exist yet — `episodes.metahub.space/<imdb>/<s>/<e>/w780.jpg`
 * 301s to the TMDB still once it is published and 404s until then, with the 404 itself carrying
 * `Cache-Control: public, max-age=345600`, cached per CDN edge. So a client that asks a few hours
 * too early gets a 404, writes it to disk, and re-throws it from disk on every launch forever —
 * without a network request that could ever notice the image had arrived. The Continue Watching
 * card then falls down its artwork chain to the show backdrop, and no amount of metadata
 * re-resolution helps, because the URL was never the problem.
 *
 * The same unconditional `read` is why a poster *service* could not tell us anything either. A
 * PostersPlus poster is a composite whose sash is a moment-in-time fact — a trending rank, an
 * "airing" status — and the service says how long that fact holds by advertising the composite's
 * own remaining life as `max-age` (a day for a trending title, weeks for a settled one) with a
 * validator derived from the bytes. This strategy caches successes only, honours the freshness the
 * origin actually declared, and revalidates by ETag when it lapses so an unchanged poster costs a
 * 304 and not a download. What it decides is also recorded in [ImageFreshnessRegistry], because
 * Coil only asks a strategy on a memory-cache miss and its memory cache never expires on its own.
 *
 * A cached failure left behind by the old strategy is never served (see `ImageDiskCachePurge` for
 * removing them from disk).
