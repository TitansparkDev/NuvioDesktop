/**
 * Reductions already performed, shared across painters and keyed by source identity plus target size.

 * is bypassed for artwork sized from its destination — see [MinCustomDownscaleRatio]. It is kept for
 * the surfaces that still reach the painter, and the numbers below describe that original workload.
 *
 * [ScaledBitmapPainter] caches its result in the painter instance, which is exactly as long-lived as
 * the card that owns it. A lazy row disposes a card the moment it leaves the viewport and builds a
 * fresh one when it comes back, so scrolling away and back threw the reduction away and paid for it
 * again - measured at 2.0-5.0 ms per card, on the draw thread, inside a 16.7 ms frame budget.
 *
 * Coil's memory cache returns the same *source* bitmap instantly in that situation; this is the
 * matching cache for the work done to it afterwards.
 *
 * Fixed size rather than a fraction of RAM, unlike the decoded-animation and Coil caches: an entry
 * here is a card-sized bitmap (a 210x315 poster is 265 KB, a large landscape card 518 KB), so useful
 * capacity is a number of cards on screen, which does not grow with the machine. 64 MB is several
 * screenfuls at every preset.
