/**
 * The screensaver proper: watches for idle input, drops a translucent black shade over the app
 * window after the configured time, and optionally counts down to a PC shutdown after a longer one.
 *
 * **Why a separate owned window rather than a Compose overlay.** The player is a native child HWND
 * (mpv) with a WebView2 HUD on top, and hero trailers are a heavyweight canvas; nothing drawn by
 * Compose can cover any of them. A top-level window owned by the app frame sits above the whole
 * hierarchy, and an owned window follows its owner in z-order, so it is never left hanging over
 * another program the user has switched to. `setOpacity` gives the dim level for free.
 *
 * **Idle time** is Windows' own (`GetLastInputInfo` via the bridge): mouse movement over the mpv
 * surface and keys into the HUD never reach AWT, so in-process listeners alone would dim the
 * screen on someone plainly using it. Controllers are not input to Windows, so the gamepad
 * poller's own timestamp is folded in. AWT events are still listened to, both as the fallback
 * when the bridge is missing (dev tree with no native build) and so the shade lifts on the very
 * first movement rather than at the next one-second tick.
 *
 * **Shutdown** is gated on the app being the foreground window on top of the idle time: idle with
 * a browser in front means someone is watching something else on this PC, not that the room is
 * asleep. The countdown is painted on the shade and any input cancels it.
 *
 * **Synthetic mouse moves.** Windows posts a `WM_MOUSEMOVE` to whatever window newly appears under
 * a stationary pointer, and showing the shade is exactly that. Taken at face value it would wake
 * the shade the moment it appeared, forever. So a motion event only counts as input when the
 * pointer has actually left the spot it was at when the shade went up; presses, wheel and keys
 * always count. The one-second tick is unaffected either way — `GetLastInputInfo` only knows
 * about real input.
 *
 * **The cursor.** A bright arrow parked on a black screen is the worst thing to leave on an OLED,
 * and nothing about dimming moves the pointer. The same synthetic move is what makes it go away:
 * the shade carries a blank cursor, and Windows re-evaluates the cursor against the window under
 * the pointer when that window changes. That only happens if the shade is hit-testable, and a
 * layered window at alpha 0 is not — so the fade starts from a barely visible alpha rather than
 * from nothing.
 *
 * Everything runs on the AWT event thread: the timer is a Swing one and the repository is only
 * ever touched from there (Compose Desktop's UI thread is the same thread).
