 * The default pad layout, in the shape a console user expects: A selects, B backs out, the
 * shoulders switch sections, and the player reuses the same face buttons for transport.
 *
 * Directions are [GamepadTarget.FixedKey] arrows because arrows are not rebindable anywhere —
 * every browsing screen matches `Key.DirectionUp`/`Down`/`Left`/`Right` literally, and the player
 * dispatcher pins them to seek/volume for exactly that reason. Everything else names an action so
 * a user who rebinds a key on the keyboard moves the pad with it.
