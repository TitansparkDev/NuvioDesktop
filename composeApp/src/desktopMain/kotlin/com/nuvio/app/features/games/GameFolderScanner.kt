 * The folder is whatever the user keeps games in: a Steam library (either its root or its
 * `steamapps/common`), any directory of one-game-per-folder installs, or a folder of shortcuts —
 * a Desktop "Games" folder, or the Start Menu's Steam folder of `.url` files. Each sub-folder
 * becomes a candidate when something runnable is found in it, named after the Steam manifest when
 * there is one and after the folder otherwise; each shortcut directly in the folder becomes one
 * named after itself, pointing at the shortcut so the entry follows it if it is re-targeted.
 *
 * Picking the executable is a heuristic, and the confirmation dialog exists because of that: a
 * game folder routinely carries an uninstaller, a crash handler, and a redistributable installer
 * alongside the game, and nothing on disk says which is which. Known helpers are filtered out by
 * name, and of what is left the one named like its folder wins, then the shallowest, then the
 * largest. The result is right far more often than not and is always editable afterwards.
