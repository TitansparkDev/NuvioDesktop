/**
 * The load-bearing assumption of gamepad support: a synthetic AWT [KeyEvent] posted to the system
 * event queue travels the same route a real keypress does, reaching both the global
 * [KeyEventDispatcher]s the player and Main install *and* Compose's `onPreviewKeyEvent` handlers
 * that every browsing screen navigates with.
 *
 * If this stops holding — a Compose Multiplatform upgrade changing how skiko takes key input, say —
 * the pad goes silent everywhere with nothing else failing, so it is worth a real window rather
 * than a reasoned argument.
 *
 * Needs a display and a focused window, and focus is global — while this runs, keystrokes meant for
 * another application land in its window instead. It is therefore **opt-in**:
 *
 *     ./gradlew desktopTest -Pnuvio.focusTests
 *
 * Run it before shipping input changes, and on CI where nobody is at the keyboard. There is no
 * offscreen equivalent: `ImageComposeScene` takes an already-converted Compose event, and Compose's
 * own AWT conversion (`toComposeEvent`) is `internal`, so an offscreen version would assert against
 * an event this test hand-built rather than the one the injector actually posts — which is the very
 * thing worth checking.
 *
 * Skipped rather than failed where a window cannot take focus, because a skip is honest and a green
 * fake is not.
