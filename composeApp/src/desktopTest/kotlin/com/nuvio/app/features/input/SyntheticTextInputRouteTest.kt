/**
 * The on-screen keyboard types by synthesizing `KEY_TYPED`, exactly as the pad's buttons synthesize
 * `KEY_PRESSED`. That is what lets it work with every text field in the app without any of them
 * knowing it exists — but only if Compose actually accepts a synthetic typed character, which is
 * not something the API promises.
 *
 * Skipped rather than failed where no window can take focus, because a skip is honest and a green
 * fake is not.
 *
 * Takes OS focus while it runs, so anything typed on the machine lands in its window instead — it
 * has swallowed a message mid-sentence before now. **Opt-in** for that reason:
 *
 *     ./gradlew desktopTest -Pnuvio.focusTests
 *
 * The assertion is about the probe characters arriving *in order*, not the field's exact contents,
 * so a stray keystroke is noise rather than a failure.
